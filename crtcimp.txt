0. Set all y_ik = 0
1. Outer Loop
  A. Solve the LP
    i. pull out o's and O
    ii. find E: the set of edges e_i where o_i = O
    iii. bool foundimprovement = false
  B. for each e_i in E:
    i. for each channel a in A such that y_ia = 0:
       a. activate channel a on e_i (set y_ia = 1)
       b. rerun the LP
       c. pull out new o's, O
       d. pull out E'
       e. if |E'| < |E| || (|E'| = |E| && O' < O)
          1. foundimprovement = true
          2. goto Outer Loop
  C. if ! foundimprovement, add a new channel a to A, goto Outer Loop
